This is the program to use the mouse actions virtualy by hand Gesture

# Abstarct
Our project, 'KYAAT', wants to change how people use computers by letting them control the mouse without touching it. We'll use special technology like cameras and hand recognition to understand how your hands move. 
Then, we'll make the computer move the mouse based on what your hands are doing. This will make it easier for people who can't move around easily to use computers.
 It'll feel more natural and fun, like you're just waving your hands to make things happen on the screen.
 We're working on making sure the system works well and is easy for everyone to use. Overall, we hope this project will make using computers more enjoyable and accessible for everyone.

# Introduction
The word KYAAT is derived from mother tongue Tamil language which means “kai” and “Aatu” (moving our hands).
Human-computer interaction has become an integral part of our daily lives. One essential component of this interaction is the input device used to control and navigate the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of computers and devices. 
While traditional physical mouse have long been the standard input device, technological advancements have given rise to virtual mouse, offering new possibilities and convenience in how we interact with technology.
Our project is called KYAAT Kinesics Mouse Control Using Gestures. We're working on a way for you to control the computer just by moving your hands.
If you wave your hand, and the computer does what you want. This makes it easier for everyone to use computers, even if they have trouble with regular mouse and keyboard.

# Objective
The goal of the 'KYAAT' project is to make a system that lets you interact with computers using your hands. We want to instruct the computer to recognize how your hand moves by using camera. 

This project helps you to use the computer without using any physical devices, which can be helpful in many situation. We also want to make sure the system is easy to use and works well for everyone. 

# Existing System
Most of the computers needs mouse and trackpads for you to access the computer. But these can be hard to use, especially if you can't move around easily.
The mouse is a key computer input device used to control the graphical user interface (GUI) through two-dimensional movements on a surface. 
Initially, mechanical mouse with rubber balls were used, later replaced by optical mouse using LED sensors, and then laser mouse for more accuracy.

#   Proposed System
The KYAAT (Virtual Mouse system) proposed in this work leverages the most efficient and expressive forms of human communication is Hand gestures. 
This modes of communication is universally understood, even by individuals. 
The system's experimental setup involves a cost-effective webcam positioned at top of a computer monitor or a fixed laptop camera, inputs that are processed to execute various mouse functions.

# Advantages
Flexibility: Users are not constrained by physical input devices like mouse or touchpads, allowing for more freedom of movement and interaction.
Space Efficiency: In environments where desk space is limited, a gesture-based control system can be more practical than traditional input devices.
Adaptability: The system can be adapted to different user preferences and needs, allowing for personalized interaction experiences.
